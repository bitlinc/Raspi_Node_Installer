# Who is this script for 
This script is designed for the user that has little to no experence with the command line interface, Bitcoin or Raspberry Pi

2. Display for your Raspberry Pi, keyboard, and mouse
3. USB 2.0/3.0 external drive - minimum 500 GB but 1 TB is recommended if you are buying a new drive
4. Internet connection that will allow the 300 GB blockchain to download and a router that allows port forwarding 
5. A macOS or Linux computer connected to the interest that can run for an extened amount of time without be shut off
    * To run a full bitcoin node you have to download the whole blockchain - this task is very difficult to do on a Pi
