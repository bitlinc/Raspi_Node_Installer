# One click Bitcoin Node || Electrum Wallet Installer
- go from a blank external drive to a full bitcoin node and a Electrum wallet connecting ONLY to your node
- mainnet and testnet run simultaneous as do both Electrum wallets
- bitcoin and Electrum are set as a service and configured to auto start with the Raspberry Pi

# Who is this script for 
This script is designed for the user that has little to no experence with the command line interface, Bitcoin or Raspberry Pi

# What is this script and what does it do
This script will setup a full Bitcoin Node for mainnet and testnet and setup Electrum Wallet to connect only to your node
    * All programs and services are configured to auto start when you boot or reboot the Pi - no input needed from user

# What you need
1. Raspberry Pi version 3 or 4 (if you haven't bought a Pi yet, I would get the 4 GB Pi 4 version)
2. Display for your Raspberry Pi, keyboard, and mouse
3. USB 2.0/3.0 external drive - minimum 500 GB but 1 TB is recommended if you are buying a new drive
4. Internet connection that will allow the 300 GB blockchain to download and a router that allows port forwarding 
5. A macOS or Linux computer connected to the interest that can run for an extened amount of time without be shut off
    * To run a full bitcoin node you have to download the whole blockchain - this task is very difficult to do on a Pi
    * The script will check what OS you are running and proceed depending on what 'operating system' is returned
    * macOS and non-Raspi Linux: Bitcoin-qt wallet is installed and the blockchain is downloaded to your external drive
